# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **Cournot Competition**. We solve a standard Cournot Comepetition problem with two competing firms. Each firm chooses an output at the same time which maximizes the profits of the firms. In the later section we extend the model and find the output for firms, when an additional firm enters the market.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
