# Inaugural project

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralprojecttake2.ipynb](inauguralprojecttake2.ipynb).

In this project, we look at Mossin's model, which is a benchmark model of insurance policies. We work on optimizing the agents' utility and the insurance company's profits.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, one needs the following packages; Numpy, Scipy and Matplotlib.
