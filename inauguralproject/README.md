# Inaugural project

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).

In this project, we look Mossin's model, which is a benchmark model of insurance policies. We work on maximizing the agents utility and the firms profits. 

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
